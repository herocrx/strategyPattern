In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern)
 is a behavioural software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
The strategy pattern defines:
 - a family of algorithms,
 - encapsulates each algorithm, and
 - makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.


 Composition should be often more usable than inheritance


 Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithm encapsulates each one and makes them interchangable.
 Strategy lets the pattern vary independently from the client that uses it.

 Against the inheritence!
